# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques on clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data cleaning and imputation
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Data Source

- [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SiqiHsiang/heart_disease_prediction.git
   cd heart_disease_prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv hdp.venv
   source hdp.venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main notebook or Python scripts to preprocess data, train models, and view results.
